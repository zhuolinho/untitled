NAME
	  qsort	- quicker sort
SYNTAX
	  void qsort ((char *) base, nel, sizeof (*base), compar)
	  unsigned nel;
	  int (*compar)( );
DESCRIPTION
	  Qsort	is an implementation of	the quicker-sort algorithm.
	  It sorts a table of data in place.
	  Base points to the element at	the base of the	table.	Nel is
	  the number of	elements in the	table.	Compar is the name of
	  the comparison function, which is called with	two arguments
	  that point to	the elements being compared.  As the function
	  must return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than
	  zero,	so must	the first argument to be considered be less
	  than,	equal to, or greater than the second.
     NOTES
	  The pointer to the base of the table should be of type
	  pointer-to-element, and cast to type pointer-to-character.
	  The comparison function need not compare every byte, so
	  arbitrary data may be	contained in the elements in addition
	  to the values	being compared.
	  The order in the output of two items which compare as	equal
	  is unpredictable.
SEE ALSO
	  bsearch(3C), lsearch(3C), string(3C).
	  sort(1) in the UNIX System V User Reference Manual.
     WARNING
	  The total size of the	table (nel x sizeof(*base)) must be
	  less than 65536 in small and large model programs.
