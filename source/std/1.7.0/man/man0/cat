.I Cat
concatenates its input files and copies the result to \fIstdout\fR.
If no input file is named, or \(en is encountered as a file name, standard
input is used.
Output is buffered in 512 byte blocks unless the 
.B \(enu
flag is given.
If you just want to copy a file, \fIcp\fR should be used since it is faster.
