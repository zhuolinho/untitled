This is the C compiler.
It has eight passes, as follows:
.HS
.if t .ta 1.4i 2.1i 2.8i
.if n .ta 13 21 30
   \fBProgram	Input	Output	Operation performed\fR
.br
   lib/ncpp	prog.c	prog.i	C preprocessor: #include, #define, #ifdef
.br
   lib/irrel	prog.i	prog.i	Removal of unnecessary prototypes
.br
   lib/ncem	prog.i	prog.k	Parsing and semantic analysis
.br
   lib/nopt	prog.k	prog.m	Optimization of the intermediate code
.br
   lib/ncg	prog.m	prog.s	Code generation
.br
   bin/as	prog.s	prog.o	Assembly
.br
   lib/ld	prog.o	prog.out	Linking
.br
   lib/cv	prog.out	a.out	Conversion to \*(Mx a.out format
.HS
In the 68000 versions of \*(Mx , the preprocessor is not called since the
front-end contains the preprocessor.  This increases compilation speed.
.PP
The main program,
.I cc ,
forks appropriately to call the passes, transmitting flags and arguments.
The \fB\(env\fR flag causes the passes to be listed as they are called, and
the \fB\(envn\fR flag causes the passes to be listed but not called.
.PP
The libraries should be made with \fIaal\fR (which is the same as \fIar\fR on the
68000 versions), and consist of .o files.  The internal order of files
inside the library is unimportant, but the order in which the libraries are
specified is.
.PP
.PP
When \fB\(enT\fR is used, the intermediate files end up in the directory
specified.  Otherwise,
.DI /tmp
is used.
When available memory is very limited (e.g., a 512K machine), it may be
necessary to run
.I chmem
to reduce the sizes of the compiler passes that do not fit, typically
.I ncem .
.PP
On the other hand, 
if the compiler (or, in fact, almost any program)
begins acting strange, it is almost always due to its running
out of space, either stack space or scratch file space.
The relevant pass can be given more stack space using
.I chmem .
More space for scratch files can be obtained
by removing other files on the device.
.PP
If the compiler runs out of memory, it may be necessary to use the
\fB\(enm\fR flag.  This causes
.I irrel
to be run, which removes unnecessary prototypes and thus frees up
extra table space within the compiler.
Beware, however,
that running this pass may cause strictly conforming programs to become
non-conforming and vice versa, so you should only run this pass as a last
resort.
.PP
The compiler is derived from the ACK system (Tanenbaum et 
al., \fICommunications of the ACM\fR, Sept. 1983),
not from the AT&T portable C compiler.
It has been shoehorned onto the PC with some loss of performance.
