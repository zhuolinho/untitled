\fIDe\fR is a program for system administrators that allows disks to be
inspected block by block.
A variety of display options and commands are available, as described in
Chap. 9.
For a summary, start the program and type \fIh\fR for help.
The program can also restore files that have just been removed by \fIrm\fR,
provided that the i-node and blocks are still intact.
Another feature is searching disks for ASCII strings, to help locate things
after a crash.
Finally, individual disk words can be changed, for example, the sizes of
block special files.
