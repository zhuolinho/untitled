\fIElvis\fR is a screen editor patterned very closely after the Berkeley
\fIvi\fR editor.  The \fIvi\fP and \fIex\fP programs are just links to
\fIelvis\fP.  In its \fIex\fP form it is essentially a much improved version
of \fIed\fP.
It has many commands, described in Chap. 9.
See also \fIctags\fR, \fIref\fR, \fIfmt\fR, and \fIelvrec\fR.
