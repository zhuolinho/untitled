\fIFix\fR accepts a diff listing produced by diff and reconstructs the
new file.  It is common for people to take a file, modify it, and then
send the diff listing between the old and new files to other people.
Using \fIfix\fR, the old file, and the diff listing, it is possible to creat
the new file.  For example:
.HS
  diff oldfile newfile >difflist
  fix oldfile difflist >new2
.HS
will generate a file \fInew2\fR that is identical to \fInewfile\fR.
A more sophisticated alternative to \fIfix\fR is \fIpatch\fR,
as \fIfix\fR only handles old-style diffs.
