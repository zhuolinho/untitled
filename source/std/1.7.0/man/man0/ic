\fIIc\fR is a reverse Polish notation calculator that works on 32-bit integers.
It starts out by computing the expression given as an argument, if any, and
then expects keyboard input.  As an example, to compute \*(OQ23+5\*(CQ one 
first converts this to reverse Polish, \*(OQ23 5+\*(CQ. 
After the calculator starts, type \*(OQ23\*(CQ followed by a carriage return.
Then type \*(OQ5\*(CQ and another carriage return.
Finally type \*(OQ+\*(CQ to see the result, 28 displayed on the stack.
Other operations work the same way.  The calculator can use other radices for
input and output, and has registers that can be stored and loaded.  The \fIh\fR
command gives the help menu.  See also Chap. 9.
