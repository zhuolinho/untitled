The text, data, bss, and total sizes for each argument are printed.
If no arguments are present, 
.I a.out
is assumed.
The amount of memory available for combined stack and data segment growth
is printed in the column \*(OQstack.\*(CQ
This is the value manipulated by the 
.I chmem
command.
The total amount of memory allocated to the program when it is loaded is
listed under \*(OQmemory.\*(CQ
This value is just the sum of the other four columns.
