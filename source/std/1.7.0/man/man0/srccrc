.PP
\fISrccrc\fP traverses the entire /usr/include and /usr/src tree to run
the crc command on all files found.  The result is a long list of
filenames with their checksums.  The filenames are relative to /usr.
.PP
The command makes an effort to remove most junk files such as .o, .bak
and files in bin directories.  It cannot find single binaries however, so
you will have to run \fBmake clean\fP in /usr/src to be able to make a crc
list that contains only source files.
.PP
Two crc files can be compared easily with the \fIdiff\fP command.  A crc
list of the original source tree can be found in /usr/src/crclist.
