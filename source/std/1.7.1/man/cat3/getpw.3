NAME
	  getpw	- get name from	UID
SYNTAX
	  int getpw (uid, buf)
	  int uid;
	  char *buf;
DESCRIPTION
	  Getpw	searches the password file for a user id number	that
	  equals uid, copies the line of the password file in which
	  uid was found	into the array pointed to by buf, and returns
	  0.  Getpw returns non-zero if	uid cannot be found.
	  This routine is included only	for compatibility with prior
	  systems and should not be used; see getpwent(3C) for
	  routines to use instead.
FILES
	  /etc/passwd
SEE ALSO
	  getpwent(3C),	passwd(4).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  Getpw	returns	non-zero on error.
     WARNING
	  The above routine uses <stdio.h>, which causes it to
	  increase, more than might be expected, the size of programs
	  not otherwise	using standard I/O.
