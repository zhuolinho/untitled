The group field (and optionally owner field) of the named files is changed to 
.I group
and
.I owner .
Alternatively, a decimal gid (uid) may be specified instead of a group name.
If the \fB\(enR\fR flag is used, the changes will be applied recursively to
all files in named directories. Only the superuser may execute this command.
