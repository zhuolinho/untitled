When a program is loaded into memory, it is allocated enough memory
for the text and data+bss segments, plus
an area for the stack.
Data segment growth using 
.I malloc ,
.I brk ,
or
.I sbrk 
eats up stack space from the low end.
The amount of stack space to allocate is derived
from a field in the executable program's file header.
If the combined stack and data segment growth exceeds the stack space
allocated, the program will be terminated.
.PP
It is therefore important to set the amount of stack space carefully.
If too little is provided, the program may crash.
If too much is provided, memory will be wasted, and fewer programs will be able
to fit in memory and run simultaneously.
.MX
does not swap, so that when memory is full, subsequent attempts to fork will
fail.
The compiler sets the stack space
to the largest possible value (for the Intel CPUs, 64K \(en text \(en data).
For many programs, this value is far too large.
Nonrecursive programs that do not call
.I brk ,
.I sbrk ,
or
.I malloc ,
and do not have any local arrays usually do not need more than 8K of stack
space.
.PP
The
.I chmem
command changes the value of the header field that determines the stack allocation, and
thus indirectly the total memory required to run the program.
The = option sets the stack size
to a specific value; the + and \(en options increment and decrement the
current value by the indicated amount.
The old and new stack sizes are printed.
