\fIDis88\fR is an 8088 disassembler.  
It takes an executable file and prints the
symbolic assembly code that corresponds to it.  If the executable file contains
a symbol table (added by the program \fIast\fR), the symbol table 
information is used to give a more readable asembly listing.
More information is provided in Chap. 9.
