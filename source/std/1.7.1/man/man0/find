\fIFind\fR descends the file tree starting at the given directory checking
each file in that directory and its subdirectories against a predicate.
If the predicate is true, an action is taken.  The predicates may be
connected by \fB\(ena\fR (Boolean and), \fB\(eno\fR (Boolean or) and !
(Boolean negation).
Each predicate is true under the conditions specified below.  The integer 
\fIn\fR may also be +\fIn\fR to mean any value greater than \fIn\fR, 
\fI\(enn\fR to mean any value less than
\fIn\fR, or just \fIn\fR for exactly \fIn\fR.
