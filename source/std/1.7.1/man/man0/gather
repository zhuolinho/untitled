It is often useful to collect all the files in a directory into one or
more archives for transmission by mail.  This program collects all the
files in the source directory (default: current directory) and puts
them into a shar archive.  The shar archive is then compressed and
uuencoded.  An attempt is made to have the final \fI.uue\fR file be
about the given size (default: 60K), but since \fIgather\fR cannot really
predict how much \fIshar\fR will add to the file, how much \fIcompress\fR
will reduce the file, and how much \fIuue\fR will add again, the sizes
can fluctuate.  If the \fB\(enf \fIfile\fR flag is given, the archives will
be given the names \fIfile_00.uue\fR, \fIfile_01.uue\fR etc.  If \fB\(enf\fR
is not given, the name of the source directory is used as the base name.
Since 7 characters of suffix are appended, the base name should not exceed
7 characters.
