A directory entry is created for
.I name .
The entry points to
.I file .
Henceforth,
.I name
and
.I file
can be used interchangeably.
If
.I name
is not supplied, the last component of
.I file
is used as the link name.
If more than one
.I file
is supplied or the
.I name
refers to an existing directory, links will be created in that directory.
An existing
.I name
will not be removed unless the \fB\(eni\fR or \fB\(enf\fR flag is specified.
.PP
.I Clone
is a convenient synonym for \fBln \(enfmr\fP to create a so-called "link farm",
a directory full of links to the original tree.
