.I Mined
(pronounced min-ed) is a simple full-screen editor.
When editing a file, it holds the file in memory, thus speeding up
editing, but limiting the editor to files of up to about 35K.
Larger files must first be cut into pieces by
.I split .
Lines may be arbitrarily long.
Output from a command may be piped into
.I mined
so it can be viewed without scrolling off the screen.
