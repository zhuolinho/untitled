In default mode, 
.I mref
produces three output files: a numbered listing of the input files
(on standard output), a global symbol table (on \fIsymbol.out\fR),
and a cross reference map to the global symbols (on \fIxref.out\fR).
A global symbol in this context is one present in a #define, PUBLIC,
PRIVATE, or SYMBOL statement (the latter being introduced to allow users
to explicitly declare certain symbols as global).
Any of the three outputs can be suppressed, or alternatively, be made
suitable for input to \fItroff\fR for typesetting.
