Sometimes one knows about an i-node number and wants to find the file
name that goes with it.  This program makes that mapping.
The default is to list everything on the device, but the \fB\(eni\fR
flag restricts the list to specified i-nodes and the \fB\(ens\fR flag
restricts it to special files and setuid files (to look for possible
security violations).
