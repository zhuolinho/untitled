\fINm\fR prints the symbol table of executable files when it is available.
If no file is given, the symbols in \fIa.out\fR are used.  
The format of the table 
is somewhat compatible with the one produced  by \fIasld\fR when used with 
the \fB\(ens\fR option. The symbol table can be added with \fIast\fR.  
Assembly language files do not have symbol tables.
