\fIReadclock\fR reads the AT's real time clock and prints the result in 
a form useful to date, namely, MMDDYYhhmmss.  
If the clock does not exist (e.g., on a
PC), it outputs \*(OQ\(enq\*(CQ to query the user for the time.  
The example given above
can be put in \fI/etc/rc\fR to load the real time when the system is booted.
