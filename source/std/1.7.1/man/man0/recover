MINIX allows files that have been deleted (e.g., with \fIrm\fR) to be
restored (in \fI/tmp\fR).
The trick is that when a file is unlinked, its i-node number is kept in
the directory entry.
As long as the directory entry and disk blocks are not reused, the file
can be recovered.
This program is actually just a little front end for \fIde\fR, which must be
installed as a set-uid root executable.
