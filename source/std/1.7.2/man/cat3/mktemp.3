NAME

SYNTAX
	  char *mktemp (template)
	  char *template;
DESCRIPTION
	  Mktemp replaces the contents of the string pointed to	by
	  template by a	unique file name, and returns the address of
	  template.  The string	in template should look	like a file
	  name with six	trailing Xs; mktemp will replace the Xs	with a
	  letter and the current process ID.  The letter will be
	  chosen so that the resulting name does not duplicate an
	  existing file.

	  getpid(2), tmpfile(3S), tmpnam(3S).
BUGS
	  It is	possible to run	out of letters.
