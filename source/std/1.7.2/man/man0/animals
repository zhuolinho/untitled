\fIAnimals\fR is a guessing game.  The user picks an animal and the 
computer tries to guess it by posing questions that should be answered by 
typing \*(OQy\*(CQ for yes and \*(OQn\*(CQ for no.  
Whenever the computer loses, it asks 
some questions that allow it to improve its database, so as time goes on, it 
learns.  The default database should be in \fI/usr/lib/animals\fR.
