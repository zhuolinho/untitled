Sometimes a file contains some nonASCII characters that are in the way.
This program allows the lines containing only ASCII characters to be 
\fIgrepped\fR from the file.  
With the \fB\(enn\fR flag, the nonASCII lines are 
\fIgrepped\fR.  
No matter whether the flag is used or not, the program returns an exit status 
of true if the file is pure ASCII, and false otherwise.
