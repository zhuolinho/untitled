\fIMail\fR is an extremely simple electronic mail program.  It can be used
to send or receive email on a single 
.MX 
system, in which case it functions
as user agent and local delivery agent.  
If the flag \fIMAILER\fR is defined in \fImail.c\fR,
it can also call a trans\%port agent to handle remote mail as well.
No such agent is supplied with
.MX .
.PP
When called by \fIuser\fR with no arguments, it examines the mailbox
\fI/usr/spool/mail/user\fR, prints one message (depending on the \fB\(enr\fR
flag), and waits for one of the following commands:
.SP 1
.HS
.nf
.ta 0.25i 1.25i
	<newline>	Go to the next message
	\(en	Print the previous message
	!command	Fork off a shell and execute \fIcommand\fR
	CTRL-D	Update the mailbox and quit (same as q)
	d	Delete the current message and go to the next one
	q	Update the mailbox and quit (same as CTRL-D)
	p	Print the current message again
	s [\fIfile\fR]	Save message in the named file
	x	Exit without updating the mailbox
.HS

.SP 1
To send mail, the program is called with the name of the recipient as an
argument.  The mail is sent, along with a postmark line containing the date.
For local delivery, a file named after the recipient in the directory
\fI/usr/spool/mail\fR must be writable.
.PP
If the directory \fI/usr/spool/mail\fR does not exist then the mail is
dumped on the console, so that system programs have a way to notify
a user on a system that does not have a mail spool.
