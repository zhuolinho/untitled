The \fIgetty\fR program allows a terminal port to be used for both dialin and
dialout. 
This little program switches the getty state, and also sends
some commands to the modem attached to the specified line.
If the \fB\(eno\fR flag is presnt, \fImodem\fR will put the 
getty process (if any) connected to the specified line into 
SUSPEND state, which means that it
will not pay attention to that line until it is reset to RESTART state.
Also, \fImodem\fR will send some (Hayes) 
commands to the attached modem to disable the auto-nanswer mode. 
The \fB\(eni\fR flag specifies the number of times the telephone has to 
ring before the modem may answer the call (to give the operator a chance).
