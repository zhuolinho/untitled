The named files are collected together into a shell archive written onto
standard output.
The individual files can be extracted by redirecting the shell archive into
the shell.
The advantage of
.I shar
over
.I ar
is that \fIshar\fP archives can be read on almost any 
.UX
system, whereas numerous, incompatible versions of
.I ar
are in widespread use.
Extracting the files from a shell archive requires that 
.I sed
be accessible.
