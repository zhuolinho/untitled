.I Sort
sorts one or more files.
If no files are specified, \fIstdin\fR is sorted.
Output is written on standard output, unless \fB\(eno\fP is specified.
The options \fB+\fIpos1 \fB\(en\fIpos2\fR use only fields \fIpos1\fR
up to but not including \fIpos2\fR as the sort key, where a field is a
string of characters delimited by spaces and tabs, unless a different field
delimiter is specified with \fB\(ent\fR.
Both \fIpos1\fR and \fIpos2\fR have the form \fIm.n\fR where \fIm\fR tells
the number of fields and \fIn\fR tells the number of characters.
Either \fIm\fR or \fIn\fR may be omitted.
