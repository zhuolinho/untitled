\fISpell\fR is the 
.MX
spelling checker.  
It is actually a short shell script.
First, the program \fIprep\fR strips off the \fIroff\fR, 
\fInroff\fR, and \fItroff\fR control lines,
and the punctuation, and lists each word on a separate line.  These words are
then sorted.  The resulting output is then compared to the dictionary.  Words
present in the file but not present in the dictionary are listed.  The
dictionary must be located in \fI/usr/lib/dict/words\fR.
