\fIYes\fP sends out an endless stream of y's, each on one line.  One
uses it to automatically say "yes" to all questions a command may ask.
This is useful for commands that ask too many "Are you sure?" questions.
The optional argument makes \fIyes\fP use \fIanswer\fP as the word to
print instead of a single y character.
