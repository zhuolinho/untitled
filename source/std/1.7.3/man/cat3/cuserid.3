NAME
	  cuserid - get	character login	name of	the user
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  char *cuserid	(s)
	  char *s;
DESCRIPTION
	  Cuserid generates a character-string representation of the
	  login	name that the owner of the current process is logged
	  in under.  If	s is a NULL pointer, this representation is
	  generated in an internal static area,	the address of which
	  is returned.	Otherwise, s is	assumed	to point to an array
	  of at	least L_cuserid	characters; the	representation is left
	  in this array.  The constant L_cuserid is defined in the
	  <stdio.h> header file.
DIAGNOSTICS
	  If the login name cannot be found, cuserid returns a NULL
	  pointer; if s	is not a NULL pointer, a null character	(\0)
	  will be placed at s[0].
