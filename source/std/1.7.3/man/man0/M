\fIM\fR and \fIU\fR allow easy mounting and unmounting of a device by using
only an abbreviated device name or keyword.  Special keywords are
\fBroot\fR, \fBtmp\fR, and \fBusr\fR for the three hard disk partitions
Minix runs in.  Floppy devices are mounted on \fB/fd0\fR or \fB/fd1\fR.  You
can use \fB0\fR and \fB1\fR instead of \fBfd0\fR and \fBfd1\fP.  A device it
doesn't know about is mounted on \fB/mnt\fR.
