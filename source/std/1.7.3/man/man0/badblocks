If a device contains bad sectors, it is important to not have them
allocated to important files.  This program makes it possible to collect
up to 7 bad blocks into a dummy file, so they will not be allocated for a 
\*(OQreal\*(CQ file.  
When the program starts up, it asks for a list of bad blocks, unless
they are provided as arguments.
Then it creates a file whose name is of the
form \fI.Bad_xxxxx\fR, where \fIxxxxx\fR is a pid.
