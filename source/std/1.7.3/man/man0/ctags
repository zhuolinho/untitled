\fICtags\fR generates a \fItags\fR file from a collection of
C source files.  It can also generate a \fIrefs\fR file.
The \fItags\fR file is used by \fIelvis'\fR 
\*(OQ:tag\*(CQ command, and its \fB\(ent\fR
option. 
Each C source file is scanned for \fI#define\fR statements and global
function definitions.  The name of the macro or function becomes the name of
a tag.  For each tag, a line is added to the \fItags\fR file which contains:
the name of the tag, a tab character, the name of the file containing the tag,
a tab character, and a way to find the particular line within the file.
.PP
The \fIrefs\fR file is used by the \fIref\fR program, which can be invoked 
via \fIelvis\fR K command.  When ctags finds a global function definition, it 
copies the function header into the \fIrefs\fR file.  
The first line is flush against the
right margin, but the argument definitions are indented.the C source files.
