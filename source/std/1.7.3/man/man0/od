.PP
.I Od
dumps a file in one or more formats.
If \fIfile\fP is missing, \fIstdin\fR is dumped.
The \fIoffset\fP argument tells
.I od
to skip a certain number of bytes or blocks before starting.
The offset is in octal bytes, unless it is followed by a 
\*(OQ.\*(CQ for decimal or \fBb\fP for blocks or both.
