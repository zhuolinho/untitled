SYSTEM CALLS
    utime		- change a file's last modified time

INVOCATION
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <utime.h>

    utime( file_name, times )
      char *file_name;
      struct utimbuf *times;

EXPLANATION
    The file's "last modified" time is set by:

	(time_t)  times->modtime

    Only the owner of a file or the super-user may change this
    file update time. If <times> is NULL, then the "last modified"
    time is set to the current time.

    There is no "last accessed" time in the MINIX file system.

RESULTS
     0 : Ok.
    -1 : Error.
