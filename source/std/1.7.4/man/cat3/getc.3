NAME
	  getc,	getchar, fgetc,	getw - get character or	word from a
	  stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int getc (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
	  int getchar ()
	  int fgetc (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
	  int getw (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Getc returns the next	character (i.e., byte) from the	named
	  input	stream,	as an integer.	It also	moves the file
	  pointer, if defined, ahead one character in stream.  Getchar
	  is defined as	getc(stdin).  Getc and getchar are macros.
	  Fgetc	behaves	like getc, but is a function rather than a
	  macro.  Fgetc	runs more slowly than getc, but	it takes less
	  space	per invocation and its name can	be passed as an
	  argument to a	function.
	  Getw returns the next	word (i.e., integer) from the named
	  input	stream.	 Getw increments the associated	file pointer,
	  if defined, to point to the next word.  The size of a	word
	  is the size of an integer and	varies from machine to
	  machine.  Getw assumes no special alignment in the file.
SEE ALSO
	  fclose(3S), ferror(3S), fopen(3S), fread(3S),	gets(3S),
	  putc(3S), scanf(3S).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  These	functions return the constant EOF at end-of-file or
	  upon an error.  Because EOF is a valid integer, ferror(3S)
	  should be used to detect getw	errors.
     WARNING
	  If the integer value returned	by getc, getchar, or fgetc is
	  stored into a	character variable and then compared against
	  the integer constant EOF, the	comparison may never succeed,
	  because sign-extension of a character	on widening to integer
	  is machine-dependent.
BUGS
				  
	  Because it is	implemented as a macro,	getc treats
	  incorrectly a	stream argument	with side effects.  In
	  particular, getc(*f++) does not work sensibly.  Fgetc	should
	  be used instead.
	  Because of possible differences in word length and byte
	  ordering, files written using	putw are machine-dependent,
	  and may not be read using getw on a different	processor.
