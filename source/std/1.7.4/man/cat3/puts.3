NAME
	  puts,	fputs -	put a string on	a stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int puts (s)
	  char *s;
	  int fputs (s,	stream)
	  char *s;
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Puts writes the null-terminated string pointed to by s,
	  followed by a	new-line character, to the standard output
	  stream stdout.
	  Fputs	writes the null-terminated string pointed to by	s to
	  the named output stream.
	  Neither function writes the terminating null character.
DIAGNOSTICS
	  Both routines	return EOF on error. This will happen if the
	  routines try to write	on a file that has not been opened for
	  writing.
SEE ALSO
	  ferror(3S), fopen(3S), fread(3S), printf(3S),	putc(3S).
     NOTES
	  Puts appends a new-line character while fputs	does not.
