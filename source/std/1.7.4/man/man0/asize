prints for each argument
the (decimal) number of bytes used by the different sections,
as well as their sum in decimal and hexadecimal.
If no
.I file
is given \fIa.out\fR is used.

can only be used to obtain the size of a \(M2 \fI.o\fR or \fI.out\fR file. 
To obtain the size of an executable, use
.I size
instead.
