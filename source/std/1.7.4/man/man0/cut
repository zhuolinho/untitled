\fICut\fR extracts one or more fields or columns from a file and writes them on
standard output.
If the \fB\(enf\fR flag is used, the fields are separated by a delimiter 
character, normally a tab, but can be changed using the \fB\(end\fR flag.
If the \fB\(enc\fR flag is used, specific columns can be specified.
The list can be comma or BLANK separated. The \fB\(enf\fR and
\fB\(enc\fR flags  are mutually exclusive.
Note: The POSIX1003.2 standard requires the option \(enb to cut out
specific bytes in a file. It is intended for systems with multi byte
characters (e.g. kanji), since MINIX uses only one byte characters,
this option is equivalent to \(enc. For the same reason, the option
\(enn has no effect and is not listed in this manual page.
