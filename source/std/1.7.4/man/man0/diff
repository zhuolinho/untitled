\fIDiff\fR compares two files and generates a list of lines telling how
the two files differ.  Lines may not be longer than 128 characters.
If the two  arguments on the command line are both directories,
\fIdiff\fR recursively steps through all subdirectories comparing
files of the same name. If a file name is found only in one directory,
a diagnostic message is written to \fIstdout\fR. A file that is of
either block special, character special or FIFO special type, cannot
be compared to any other file.
On the other hand, if there is one directory and one file given on the
command line, \fIdiff\fR tries to compare the file with the same name
as \fIfile\fR in the directory \fIdirectory\fR.
