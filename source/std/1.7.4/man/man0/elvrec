\fIElvrec\fR is used to recover an edit session after a crash.
Both \fIelvis\fR and \fIex\fR keep scratch files in \fI/usr/tmp\fR.
After an editor crash, this information is used to reconstruct the file.
If \fIelvrec\fR is called with no file name, it expects one of these
temporary files on \fIstdin\fR.
