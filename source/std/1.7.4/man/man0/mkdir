The specified directory or directories are created and initialized. If any
intermediate directory is missing and \fB\(enp\fR is specified, the missing
component will be created and no error displayed if directory already
exists. If the \fB\(enm\fR flag is used, this will be equivalent to a chmod
on the directory after its creation.
