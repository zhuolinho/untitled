\fIPretty\fR converts one or more C source files to 
.MX 
format by changing 
their layout.  Running this program does not affect the resulting binary
programs.  Actually, \fIpretty\fR is a postprocessor for \fIindent\fR, which
must be installed in \fI/bin\fR or \fI/usr/bin\fR.  Although the output is
not bad, it is not entirely consistent with the book or even with itself.
