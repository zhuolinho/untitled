\fIUname\fP and \fIarch\fP give information about the system.  The options
indicate which information strings must be printed.  These strings are always
in the same order.  \fIUname\fP and \fIarch\fP only differ w.r.t. the default
string to print, \fB\(ens\fP and \fB\(enp\fP respectively.
.PP
The strings are compiled into the commands except for the node name, it is
obtained from the file \fI/etc/hostname.file\fP.  \fBUname \(enm\fP should
return the actual machine type, not the same string as with \fB\(enp\fP.
