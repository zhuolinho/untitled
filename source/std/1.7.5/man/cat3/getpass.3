NAME
	  getpass - read a password
SYNTAX
	  char *getpass	(prompt)
	  char *prompt;
DESCRIPTION
	  Getpass reads	up to a	newline	or EOF from the	file /dev/tty,
	  after	prompting on the standard error	output with the	null-
	  terminated string prompt and disabling echoing.  A pointer
	  is returned to a null-terminated string of at	most 8
	  characters.  If /dev/tty cannot be opened, a NULL pointer is
	  returned.  An	interrupt will terminate input and send	an
	  interrupt signal to the calling program before returning.
FILES
	  /dev/tty
SEE ALSO
	  crypt(3C).
     WARNING
	  The above routine uses <stdio.h>, which causes it to
	  increase the size of programs	not otherwise using standard
	  I/O, more than might be expected.
BUGS
	  The return value points to static data whose content is
	  overwritten by each call.
