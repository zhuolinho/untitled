.I Adduser
adds a new user to the system by making new entries in
.B /etc/passwd
and
.B /etc/shadow
for the new user, creating a new home directory, and copying the contents
of the template home directory
.B /usr/ast
into it.  The user-id of this new user will be the first free number not less
than 10.  The password is initially empty, the full name must be set, and
the shell is the Bourne Shell,
.B /bin/sh .
Use
