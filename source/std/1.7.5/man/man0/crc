The checksum of each argument is computed and printed, along with the file
length and its name, one file per line.
This program is useful for seeing if a file transmitted to another machine
has arrived correctly.
It is conceptually similar to \fIsum\fR, except that it uses a stronger 
checksum algorithm and also prints the length.
