.I Dosdir
reads standard IBM PC diskettes or hard disk partitions in
\s-2MS-DOS\s+2 format and lists their contents on standard output.
Directory names should contain slashes to separate components, even though
\s-2MS-DOS\s+2 uses backslashes.
The names
.I dosdir ,
.I dosread ,
and 
.I doswrite
are all links to the same program.
The program sees which function to perform by seeing how it was called.
A drive code of
.I A
causes the program to use \fI/dev/dosA\fR, for example, 
a link to \fI/dev/fd0\fR.
Similarly, to have hard disk partition 1 be DOS drive C, \fI/dev/dosC\fR 
could be a link to \fI/dev/hd1\fR, and so on for other drive codes.
A normal device name may also be used instead of a drive code.
