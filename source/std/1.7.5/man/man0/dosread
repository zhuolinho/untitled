.I Dosread
reads one \s-2MS-DOS\s+2 file and writes it on standard output.
The file name must use slash, not backslash as a separator.
ASCII files have the final CTRL-Z stripped, and carriage return plus
line feed are mapped to line feed only, the usual
.MX
convention.  See \fBdosdir\fR on the use of single letter drive codes.
