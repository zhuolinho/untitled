.I Mv
moves one or more files from one place in the file system to another.
If the old path and new path are on the same device, it is done by renaming
otherwise by copying. If you're not superuser, the copy will destroy the
file's owner, group and setuid/setgid bits.
.I mv
will prompt before removing non-writable files if \fBstdin\fR is a terminal
or the \fB\(eni\fR flag was specified.
