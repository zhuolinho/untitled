\fIReadall\fR reads all of the named device in large chunks.  
It reports about blocks that it cannot read.  
Unlike \fIdiskcheck\fR, it does not attempt to write on
the disk, making it safer to use when one is worried about a sick system.
When the \fB\(enb\fR flag is given, the output is a shell script that
calls the \fIbadblocks\fR program to marked all the bad blocks.
Whenever installing 
.MX ,
it is wise to run \fIreadall\fR with the \fB\(enb\fR flag first on all
the hard disks.
