\fIWrite\fR lets a user send messages to another logged-in user.  
Lines typed by the user appear on the other user's screen a line at a time 
(a character at a time in the case of cbreak mode).  
The file \fI/usr/adm/wtmp\fR is searched to determine which tty to send to. 
If the user is logged onto more than one terminal, the \fItty\fR argument
selects the terminal.  Type CTRL- D to terminate the command.
Use ! as a shell escape.
